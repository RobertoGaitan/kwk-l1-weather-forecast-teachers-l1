# Your methods should take in a hash as an argument - here's an example of what the hash will look like -
# the methods should take this hash as an argument and return the desired output.

 weather = {
 	:city => "New York",
 	:description => "Partly Cloudy",
 	:temperature_farenheit => 66.3
 }

# 1. Complete the method below called location, that accepts a hash called weather as an argument so that it returns the value of city from the weather hash.
def location(city_weather_info)
	city_weather_info.each {|city, description, temp|
	return city_weather_info[:city]
	}
end

# 2. Using the location method as a guide, write a  method called "description" so it returns the description from the weather hash.
def description(city_weather_info)
	city_weather_info.each {|city, description, temp|
	city_weather_info[:description]
	}
end

# 3. Using the methods above and string interpolation, update the method below so that it returns a string that describes the current weather -
# for example: "The weather in New York is Partly Cloudy. The temperature is 66.1 degrees Farenheit." HINT: the method should RETURN the string,
# not print it to the terminal.

def weather_report(weather)
	weather.each {|city, description, temperature_farenheit|
	return "The weather in #{weather[:city]} is #{weather[:description]}. The temperature is #{weather[:temperature]} degrees Farenheit."

	}
end


#4. Write a method that takes in the weather hash as an argument.
# You'll want to use the each method to iterate over the hash and print out
# `The city is New York.` `The description is Partly Cloudy.` `The temperature is 66.3.`

def city_weather_info(city_weather_info)
	city_weather_info.each {|city, description, temp|
		"The #{city_weather_info[:city]}. The description is #{city_weather_info[:description]}. The temperature is #{city_weather_info[:temp]}."
	}
end

# BONUS:  Write a method that takes in the weather hash as an argument and converts the farenheit temperature to celcius.
#Have the method round your answer to two decimal places. Is there a method we can use to round in Ruby?

# Hint - how can we find the algorithm to convert Farenheit to Celsius?
def convert_temp(city_weather_info)
	city_weather_info.each {|city, description, temp|
		temp_in_c = (city_weather_info[:temp] - 32) * 0.5555814
		return (Integer(temp_in_c * 100) / Float(100))

	}
end
